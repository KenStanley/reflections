What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git directory and starts keeping track of your commits.

git diff compares working directory to staging area
git diff --staged  compares staging area to the most recent commit

I haven't figured out when to use branching.

git checkout -b new_branch  creates a new branch and checks it out 

git show fc2345  diffs a commit with its parent

git merge --abort - might get me back to the start - we'll see 

That failed, but this worked:  git reset --hard HEAD
