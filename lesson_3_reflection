Whatever this is added in GitHub 

git fetch creates origin/master on the local cpmputer

pull requests on GitHub are a bit comfusing - It is asking someone else to do a merge of a new branch into the master branch

I think that before you do a pull request, you have to create a branch in the forked version of the code.
